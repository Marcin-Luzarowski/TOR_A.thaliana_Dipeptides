# TOR_A.thaliana_Dipeptides
This repository contains files for analysis of dipeptides and amino acids level fluctuation during diurnal cycle of A. thaliana.
Repository contains of the following R-code:
1)	R-script for data filtering and normalization:
•	Filter frequently occurring mass features detected by mass spectrometry
•	Normalize to median intensity
2)	R-script for data visualization and analysis:
•	Calculate mean and standard deviation of each group of samples measured in the experiment
•	Generate plots showing each recorded intensity for measured metabolite over time
•	Perform analysis of putative protein partners of selected dipeptides using PROMIS dataset (Veyel et al., 2018)
•	Generate heatmap and perform k-means clustering of the data
